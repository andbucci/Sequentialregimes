The empirical sizes can be computed running the file "Simulations.R", where one should specify "B1", "T1", and "ny" to get the different panels in the article.

The selection frequencies can be obtained running the file "Selection frequencies.R".

The empirical analysis in Section 6 is replicated by the code "Empirical.R".

The file "LMtest.R" contains the code to run the tests proposed in the paper.

The file "misc.R" contains all the necessary auxiliary functions to execute simulations and empirical analysis.

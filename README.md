# Sequentialregimes repository

This repository is attached to the paper "A sequential test procedure for the choice of the number of regimes in multivariate nonlinear models".

## Usage

The empirical sizes can be computed running the file "Empirical size.R", where one should specify "B1" and "T1" to get the different panels in the article.

The selection frequencies can be obtained running the file "Selection frequencies.R".

The empirical analysis in Section 6 is replicated by the code "Empirical.R".

The file "LMtest.R" contains the code to run the tests proposed in the paper.

The file "misc.R" contains all the necessary auxiliary functions to execute simulations and empirical analysis.
